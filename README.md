# Welcome to My Data Science Journey! 👋

Hello, I'm @Vortable, a passionate social entrepreneur on a mission to make the world of data science more inclusive and accessible. I design and deliver science programs tailored for grrrls (girls and non-binary individuals) and their allies, fostering a love for data-driven discovery while advocating for plain language and accessible information.

## About Me
